# LAIG
#Structure
* List of nodes works through [ID]
* noticed that the getElementsbyTag might not work and we might need to change it to temp.children[0] //fixed

#Components
* Falta a parte children //fixed
* duvidas no tratamento da matriz //fixed
* duvidas em certas condições se são aplicaveis ou não //fixed
* necessita mais comentários //fixed

#Animations
* Both Animations working but linear isn't as suposed
* Issue with duration/span/time almost seems like the algorith is thinking that span is minutes or hours instead of seconds

#Patch/Plane
* Not started, no issues at the moment

#Shaders
* Not started

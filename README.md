* duvidas no tratamento da matriz //fixed
* duvidas em certas condições se são aplicaveis ou não //fixed

#Animations
* Both Animations working but linear isn't as suposed-> because of missing push and popmatrix somewhere, animations are afected by the previous animation... 
* Issue with duration/span/time almost seems like the algorith is thinking that span is minutes or hours instead of seconds
